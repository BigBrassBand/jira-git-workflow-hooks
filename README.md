# jira-git-workflow-hooks
[Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira) JavaScript Hooks.

*Required version of Git Integration for Jira: 2.20 and above.*

# Script paths and locations

Script engine searches for scripts in `<Jira-HOME>/data/git-plugin/scripts`
folder.

Smart commit scripts are expected to be in
`<Jira-HOME>/data/git-plugin/scripts/smartcommit` folder.


There is a cache for disk script lookup results. Script engine checks for `.js`
file modification timestamp and if it has changed (or even it has gone away)
then the disk script will be reloaded. Also there is a 5 seconds
interval after the last check when the script engine does not re-check script on
disk and just uses the cached script. It reduces the number of disk operations
when a lot of scripts are executed in a small period of time.

# Script debugging
  
It is possible to connect Nashorn debugger to Jira and debug scripts which is run through the script service. 
To achieve it please do the next:
  * Build NCDbg. Sources can be found [here](https://github.com/provegard/ncdbg).
  * Jira should be run with enabled debugger, i.e. the next arguments should be passed:  
    `-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=localhost: *port*`  
    `atlas-debug` command can be used as already has debugger enabled.
  * Run ncdbg using the next command line: `bin/ncdbg -c localhost: *port*`  
    Default Jira port 5005 can be used in case of using atlas-debug command.
  * Google Chrome DevTools or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be used for debugging.
  * Next steps for Visual Studio Code are described [here](https://github.com/provegard/ncdbg/blob/master/docs/VSCode.md)
  * In case of some issues with Google Chrome DevTools [Issues Page](https://github.com/provegard/ncdbg/issues) and [Troubleshooting Page](https://github.com/provegard/ncdbg/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md) will be very usefull.  
  
In particular, if breakpoints will not work correctly in Google Chrome DevTools you should remove `v8only` query param from url generated by ncdbg( [details here](https://github.com/provegard/ncdbg/issues/100) ).
